# TASK-2
# To-Do List App

## Description

This is a fully functional and stylish To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The base layout and structure were created by referring to YouTube tutorials for basic concepts. However, several advanced alignments, interactivity, and styling. Some help has been taken from ai assitance while alignment and scripting javascript, as I encountered difficulties implementing and aligning some features precisely.

The images (such as buttons/icons and backgrounds) were downloaded from Google for illustrative purposes. All code and design decisions have been reviewed and personalized to match the intended visual and functional output.

## How it Works

1. User types a task in the input box and clicks the **plus button** or presses **Enter**.
2. The task appears below with two icons: **edit** and **delete**.
3. Clicking the **edit icon** loads the task back into the input field (if not already completed).
4. Clicking the **delete icon** removes the task from the list.
5. Ticking the **checkbox** marks the task as completed with a strikethrough effect.
6. If the list becomes empty, an empty-state image is shown.

## Technologies Used
